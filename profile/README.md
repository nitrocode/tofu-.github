[OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu) is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. It is hosted by the **Linux Foundation (LF)**.

## Why OpenTofu?

- **Manage any infrastructure**
Find providers for many of the platforms and services you already use in the Public OpenTofu Registry. You can also write your own. OpenTofu takes an immutable approach to infrastructure, reducing the complexity of upgrading or modifying your services and infrastructure.

- **Track your infrastructure**
OpenTofu generates a plan and prompts you for your approval before modifying your infrastructure. It also keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which acts as a source of truth for your environment. OpenTofu uses the state file to determine the changes to make to your infrastructure so that it will match your configuration.

- **Automate changes**
OpenTofu configuration files are declarative, meaning that they describe the end state of your infrastructure. You do not need to write step-by-step instructions to create resources because OpenTofu handles the underlying logic. OpenTofu builds a resource graph to determine resource dependencies and creates or modifies non-dependent resources in parallel. This allows OpenTofu to provision resources efficiently.

- **Standardize configurations**
OpenTofu supports reusable configuration components called modules that define configurable collections of infrastructure, saving time and encouraging best practices. You can use publicly available modules from the OpenTofu Registry, or write your own.

- **Collaborate**
Since your configuration is written in a file, you can commit it to a Version Control System (VCS) and use a cloud backend to efficiently manage OpenTofu workflows across teams. A cloud backend runs OpenTofu in a consistent, reliable environment and provides secure access to shared state and secret data, role-based access controls, a private registry for sharing both modules and providers, and more.
